# Plogalong

  ***Plogalong*** is an app for iOS and Android designed to encourage new and
  existing [ploggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plogging) to record the litter they pick up while walking,
  running, or exercising outdoors.
  
  This is a project of [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org). If you would like to get involved
  in helping us develop the app, join us at the next [Hack Night](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Boston/), and we can
  help you get started.
  
  We're in the beginning stages of development, but we have a very detailed
  [Mockup](https://marvelapp.com/96b0bd4/screen/53564903).

## Architectural Overview

  This is a young project. We're still figuring out what the pieces are and how
  they'll fit together.

  - React-Native + Expo

  - State Manager (TBD)

  - Database (TBD)

  - Authentication (TBD)

## Setup Instructions

  - Clone this repository

  - Node (>=10.x) -- ensure that you have a recent version installed

  - (iOS) Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
    _This may take a while... why not go plogging for an hour?_

  - (Android) Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and create a virtual device

    [See here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) for detailed instructions

  - Install Expo: `npm install expo-cli --global`
  
  - In a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of your local clone of
    this repository. Type `expo start` to launch Metro bundler and Expo's
    browser-based developer tools. 
    
  - While Expo runs, you can type `a` at the terminal to run the app in an
    Android emulator or `i` to run it in the iOS simulator; or you can use
    Expo's local web interface.
